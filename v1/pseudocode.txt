Function order:

"newFormFunction" deletes our newFormButton and creates our form elements and appends them inside our container
"formSubmittedFunction" saves the info the user put into the form into our myLibrary array using our constructor function
"cardCreatorFunction" creates the elements used for our book card, adds the info from our myLibrary array and appends it to the page.
"replaceNewCardButton" re-creates the newFormButton and appends it to our container
myLibrary[myLibrary.length - 1] would be the object containing the info the user had just submitted at that point. So:
title = myLibrary[myLibrary.length - 1].title
author = myLibrary[myLibrary.length - 1].author
pagesRead = myLibrary[myLibrary.length - 1].pagesRead
totalPages = myLibrary[myLibrary.length - 1].totalPages



"formSubmittedFunction" contains:
"constructorFunction"
